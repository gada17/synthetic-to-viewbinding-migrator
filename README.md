## üìñ Introduction

As Android development evolves, it's essential to keep up with the latest practices. Synthetic imports were once a popular way to access views in fragments, but they have become outdated. ViewBinding offers a safer, more efficient way to handle UI components. This repository provides a straightforward solution to transition from synthetic imports to ViewBinding seamlessly.

## üöÄ Features

- **Automated Migration**: Converts synthetic imports to ViewBinding automatically.
- **Type Safety**: Ensures type-safe access to views, reducing runtime errors.
- **Easy Integration**: Works well with existing Android projects.
- **Support for Fragments**: Specifically designed for Kotlin Android Fragments.
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Clear instructions for setup and usage.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Installation

To get started with the Synthetic to ViewBinding Migrator, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gada17/synthetic-to-viewbinding-migrator.git
   cd synthetic-to-viewbinding-migrator
   ```

2. **Download the Latest Release**:
   Visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/gada17/synthetic-to-viewbinding-migrator/releases) to download the latest version. Make sure to execute the file after downloading.

### Usage

After installation, you can start using the migrator. Here‚Äôs how:

1. **Open Your Project**: Navigate to your Android project directory.
2. **Run the Migrator**: Use the following command to start the migration process:
   ```bash
   ./migrator --input <path-to-your-fragment-file>
   ```

3. **Check the Output**: The migrator will generate a new file with ViewBinding code.

## üîÑ Migration Process

Migrating from synthetic imports to ViewBinding involves several steps:

1. **Identify Synthetic Imports**: The tool scans your fragment files for synthetic imports.
2. **Generate ViewBinding Code**: It generates the necessary ViewBinding code.
3. **Replace Old Code**: The tool replaces the old synthetic code with the new ViewBinding code.
4. **Output New Fragment File**: The migrator creates a new file or modifies the existing one based on your preferences.

## üñºÔ∏è Examples

Here‚Äôs a simple example to illustrate the migration process.

### Before Migration

```kotlin
class MyFragment : Fragment() {
    override fun onCreateView(
        inflater: LayoutInflater, container: ViewGroup?,
        savedInstanceState: Bundle?
    ): View? {
        return inflater.inflate(R.layout.fragment_my, container, false)
    }

    override fun onViewCreated(view: View, savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        myTextView.text = "Hello, World!" // Synthetic import
    }
}
```

### After Migration

```kotlin
class MyFragment : Fragment() {
    private var _binding: FragmentMyBinding? = null
    private val binding get() = _binding!!

    override fun onCreateView(
        inflater: LayoutInflater, container: ViewGroup?,
        savedInstanceState: Bundle?
    ): View? {
        _binding = FragmentMyBinding.inflate(inflater, container, false)
        return binding.root
    }

    override fun onViewCreated(view: View, savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        binding.myTextView.text = "Hello, World!" // ViewBinding
    }

    override fun onDestroyView() {
        super.onDestroyView()
        _binding = null
    }
}
```
